# Music-Generation-Using-GAN
<h3>Here we have implemented a project where it takes different songs as input and produces a similar song to the ones that are given as input.</h3>
<h2>.</h2><h3>Our model consists of Generator Network which tires to map the input distribution and a Discriminator network that diferenciates between real and fake song.</h3>
